## About
Security engineer with hands-on SOC experience and graduate training in Cybersecurity Analytics & Operations (Penn State). I focus on building high-signal detections, resilient playbooks, and automation that keeps response fast without burning out analysts.

## Core Impact
- Raise detection fidelity and cut false positives through targeted tuning
- Design incident playbooks that are usable under pressure
- Automate repetitive SOC workflows with Python/Bash
- Investigate endpoint, network, and identity telemetry with a threat-first mindset

## Experience
**Workato - Security Operations Engineer**  
- Frontline alert triage, endpoint investigations, and policy enforcement (SentinelOne, Zscaler).  
- Improved detection quality and response workflows across endpoint and network telemetry.  

**Trainocate - Security Lab Engineer**  
- Built/maintained blue-team labs aligned to CCNA networking fundamentals.  
- Analyzed IDS and packet data to strengthen TCP/IP and threat detection skills.  

## Strengths
- Detection engineering and alert tuning
- SOC triage and incident response execution
- Network traffic analysis and TCP/IP fundamentals
- Security automation with Python and Bash
- Secure coding and vulnerability-aware development

## Toolkit
`Splunk` `OpenSearch` `Elastic Stack` `SentinelOne` `Zscaler` `Okta` `Wireshark` `Python` `Bash` `Linux` `Docker` `AWS` `Git`

## Featured Projects
- **LogSentinel** - Behavioral anomaly IDS for SOC-style log monitoring. [View](https://github.com/mahendraravichandran/LogSentinel)
- **PortSwigger Automation** - Python automation for Web Security Academy labs. [View](https://github.com/mahendraravichandran/Portswigger-pyhton-exploytation)

## Certifications
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate
- Blue Team Level 1
- CompTIA Security+ (targeted)
- CCNA (in progress)
- Burp Suite track (in progress)

## Let's Talk
I'm interested in Security Engineer and Detection Engineer roles.  
Reach out on LinkedIn or email; best discussions start with a real problem statement and end with a better runbook.
