## 👋 About Me
Master's student in Cybersecurity Analytics & Operations at Penn State (GPA 3.89), passionate about SOC workflows, detection engineering, and practical security tooling. Professional experience includes monitoring high-volume security telemetry, tuning detections, and building labs for security training.

---

## � Professional Experience
During my time at **Workato** I operated within the security operations center, handling alert triage, detection tuning, endpoint investigations, and policy enforcement across products like SentinelOne and Zscaler. I also documented playbooks and helped streamline incident response.

At **Trainocate** I built and maintained virtual lab environments for hands‑on SOC training while analyzing traffic and IDS logs to support security exercises.
