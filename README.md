### 🎯 What I Do

I transform security telemetry into actionable intelligence. Currently pursuing my **Master's in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations** at Penn State, I specialize in:

- **Detection Engineering** — Crafting high-fidelity alerts that cut through noise
- **SOC Operations** — Real-world triage, investigation, and incident response
- **Security Automation** — Building Python tools that scale security operations
- **Threat Analysis** — Deep-diving into network traffic and endpoint behavior

<br>

### 💼 Professional Experience

**Security Operations Engineer** @ Workato  
*Production SOC environment • Endpoint & Network Security*

Operating at the frontline of enterprise security, performing alert triage and incident response with tools like SentinelOne and Zscaler. Focused on detection quality through continuous alert tuning and strengthening response workflows across endpoint and network telemetry.

**Security Lab Engineer** @ Trainocate  
*Network Security Infrastructure • Traffic Analysis*

Designed and maintained networking lab environments aligned with enterprise security standards. Specialized in network traffic analysis, IDS log correlation, and reinforcing TCP/IP security fundamentals through hands-on threat detection scenarios.

### 💡 Philosophy

> *"Security is not about eliminating all risks—it's about understanding them well enough to make informed decisions and respond effectively when things go wrong."*

I believe the best security engineers combine deep technical knowledge with practical operational experience. My approach focuses on building sustainable security programs through automation, continuous improvement, and collaboration.
