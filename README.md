## About
Security engineer with hands-on SOC experience, networking fundamentals, and graduate training in Cybersecurity Analytics & Operations (Penn State). I focus on building high-signal detections, secure-by-default code paths, and incident response automation that keeps containment fast without burning out analysts.

## Core Impact
- Raise detection fidelity and cut false positives through targeted tuning
- Automate repetitive SOC and incident response workflows with Python/Bash
- Investigate endpoint, network, and identity telemetry with a threat-first mindset
- Apply secure coding practices to reduce exploitable surface in tooling and scripts
- Design network-aware detections that account for routing, segmentation, and east-west traffic

## Experience
**Workato - Security Operations Engineer**  
- Frontline alert triage, endpoint investigations, and policy enforcement (SentinelOne, Zscaler).  
- Improved detection quality and response workflows across endpoint and network telemetry; collaborated with engineering to harden controls and IR runbooks.  

**Trainocate - Security Lab Engineer**  
- Built/maintained blue-team labs aligned to CCNA networking fundamentals.  
- Analyzed IDS and packet data to strengthen TCP/IP and threat detection skills.  

## Strengths
- Incident response and SOC triage (SIEM/SOAR)
- Detection engineering and alert tuning
- Network traffic analysis, packet captures, and TCP/IP fundamentals (routing, switching, VLANs)
- Security automation with Python and Bash
- Secure coding and vulnerability-aware development (linting, dependency hygiene, code review)

## Toolkit
`Splunk` `OpenSearch` `Elastic Stack` `SentinelOne` `Zscaler` `Okta` `Wireshark` `Python` `Bash` `Linux` `Docker` `AWS` `Git`

## Networking Focus
- Packet capture and analysis for threat hunting (tcpdump/Wireshark filters, PCAP triage)
- Routing/switching fundamentals with VLAN segmentation and ACL hygiene
- IDS/IPS tuning for noisy networks without losing true positives
- Zero-trust-aligned access control: least-privilege and policy reviews

## Certifications
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate
- Blue Team Level 1
- CompTIA Security+ (targeted)
- CCNA (in progress)
- Burp Suite track (in progress)

## Let's Talk
I have operated in SOC environments and I'm interested in Security Engineer roles focused on SOC operations and network security.  
Reach out on LinkedIn or email; best discussions start with a real problem statement and end with a better runbook.
